# Web Scraping Demo

To demonstrate that web scraping can produce extra load on a server, you can run `server.py` in one terminal, and then scrape that service using `scraper.py` and watch how CPU utilization changes.

Feel free to change the contents of the service or the aggressiveness of the scraper to see its effects.
